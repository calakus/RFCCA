Description: Random Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis (RFCCA) is a 
  random forest method for estimating the canonical correlations between two 
  sets of variables depending on the subject-related covariates. The trees are 
  built with a splitting rule specifically designed to partition the data to 
  maximize the canonical correlation heterogeneity between child nodes.
